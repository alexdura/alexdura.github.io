I'm Alexandru Dura and this is my personal website.
Since 2018 I am studying towards a PhD degree at the Department of Computer Science at Lund University. My general topic is applying program analysis techniques to improve program performance and my current focus is declarative program analysis. I am a member of the <a href="http://sde.cs.lth.se/">Software Development and Environments</a> research group and my doctoral advisor is <a href="http://creichen.net">dr. Christoph Reichenbach</a>.

Between 2010 and 2018, I developed compilers for Arm and Movidius. For two thirds of this period I worked with machine code generation for highly specialized architectures (GPUs and VPUs), while the other third I spent building graphics-specific language frontends and optimizations.
