I am a compiler engineer with a PhD in static program analysis.

<p/>

I did my PhD at Lund University, under the supervision of <a href="https://creichen.net">Christoph Reichenbach</a> and <a href="https://emso.gitlab.io">Emma SÃ¶derberg</a>. In my thesis, I explore declarative techniques for building static code checkers that have comparable performance and analysis quality with state-of-the-practice tools. The aim of this work is to reduce the overhead of defining bug detectors, and thus enable more software developers to customize static code checkers for the needs of their projects.

<p/>
Before this, I developed compilers for Arm (2012-2018) and Movidius (2010-2012). I contributed to all stages of a compiler pipeline, from machine code generation for highly specialized architectures (GPUs and VPUs) to graphics-specific language frontends and optimizations.
